AXIOS DOCUMENTATION
Axios is a popular, promise-based HTTP client that is widely used in React Native and Expo projects for making API requests. It simplifies the process of sending and receiving data from external servers.
Key features and benefits of using Axios in React Native/Expo:
Simplified Syntax:
Axios provides a cleaner and more readable syntax compared to the built-in fetch API for making HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
Promise-based:
It leverages JavaScript Promises, making asynchronous operations and error handling more manageable and readable.
Automatic JSON Transformation:
Axios automatically converts JSON responses into JavaScript objects, eliminating the need for manual parsing with JSON.parse().
Interceptors:
You can set up request and response interceptors to perform actions globally, such as adding authentication tokens to headers, logging requests, or handling errors consistently.
Error Handling:
Axios provides robust error handling mechanisms, allowing you to catch and manage network errors, server errors, and other issues effectively.
Request Cancellation:
Axios supports canceling ongoing requests, which is useful in scenarios like preventing race conditions or handling unmounted components.
How to use Axios in an Expo React Native project:
Installation: Install Axios in your project by running:
Code

    npm install axios
    # or
    yarn add axios
